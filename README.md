# Powershell4all
The idea of this project is an open collaboration between skilled Powershell professionals, who are integrating the usual daily tasks of a Microsoft System Administrator into functions.

Functions are here to serve their user(admin) with the ease of administration.

This collaboration project is open, anyone who is willing to contribute is very WELCOME, please see the contact information below!

We are hosting the main project on the GitHub link: https://github.com/nemanja-jovic/powershell4all

The script is still in its early and fresh stage, we are planning to add many functionalities related to many Microsoft technologies.

If you notice any bugs or you have any advice for improvements, please advice us!
